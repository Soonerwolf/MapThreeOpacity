# MapThreeOpacity

Demonstrating issues with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) textures that have a transparent color.  When rendered over a [MapLibre-GL-JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/) map, the map does not show through the transparent color.  Instead, the base color of the renderer/scene is shown. 

This project uses [bun](https://bun.com) and [vite](https://vite.dev/) as development tools.
